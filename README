Features
========

   Upmf is a package manager, uniting the good things of two other source
based package managers, Gentoo's Portage and Paldo's Upkg, and adding some
own ideas:

  * Package specification files: Upmf uses an advanced XML format, derived
    from Upkg's XML format.  Upmf strives to keep compatibility with Upkg's
    package files, thus giving access to Paldo's growing repository.
  * Attributes in package file: Provide information about URI of source,
    description and licensing.
  * USE flags: The user can customize the features of a package.  If a USE
    flag is enabled, the feature will be built, otherwise not.
  * Build types: Provide predefined ways to build a package.  This avoids
    massive duplication of the same lines (./configure && ...) like in
    Upkg's package files.
  * Sections: Give packages a namespace.  This is much like the first part
    in Gentoo package names, e.g. dev-lang in dev-lang/vala.
  * Installation of a package: Upmf uses GNU Stow for installation of
    packages.  In contrast, Portage installs a package to a special
    install directory, creates an archive from that and then extracts that
    archive in the root file system.  Upmf + Stow should be faster here,
    especially on big-sized packages.

Installation
============

Please see the file INSTALL for detailed installation information.
If you are using the sources from GIT, you must run ./autogen.sh beforehand.

Dependencies
============

libxml-2.0 >= 2.8.0 http://xmlsoft.org/ Expat license

Acquiring package files
=======================

   Currently, there are no package files available for Upmf.  You can
find a draft file in this distribution though (data/ktorrent.xml). It
is commented from head to foot and gets installed by make install. I
chose KTorrent because you can make a rather complex package file for it.
